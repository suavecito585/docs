## Annotations {#annotations}

| Annotation | Value |
|---|---|
| Read-only | no |
| Destructive | no |
| Idempotent | no |
| Accepts an idempotency key | no |

`Idempotent` is the advisory MCP `idempotentHint`. `Destructive` is also `yes` for a tool that
asks for confirmation only on some calls.

## Confirmation (human in the loop) {#confirmation-human-in-the-loop}

No human confirmation is required to call this tool.
